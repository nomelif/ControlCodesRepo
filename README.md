First Global Control Codes
==========================

This repository allows teams competing in the First Global 2017 Challenge to share their control codes and learn from each other.

You can submit your team's code via push request. If you don't specify otherwise, we take your code to be MIT-lisenced so that it can be freely studied and reused by other teams.

For clarity you should create a directory as follows:

Team `Country`

 * `OPMode.java` - Your team's code
 * `README.md` - A few words documenting your code and your robot in general. You can also add a license if you wish. We recommend one of the three licenses listed [here](https://choosealicense.com/).

You can also optionally add any files you want. We encourage you to link to your [Robodex page](https://robodex.win).

If you have further inquiries, contact GitHub user nomelif via PM, create an issue here or contac me via email at [theo.friberg@gmail.com](mailto:theo.friberg@gmail.com).
